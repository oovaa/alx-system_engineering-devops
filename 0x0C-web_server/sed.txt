# FILEPATH

# This code performs a sed command with various flags.
# Sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
# The flags used in this command are explained below.

# -e: Specifies the script to be executed.
# -i: Edits files in-place, i.e., modifies the file directly.
# -n: Suppresses automatic printing of pattern space.
# -r: Enables extended regular expressions.
# -s: Substitutes the first occurrence of a pattern with a replacement.

# Example usage:
# sed -e 's/foo/bar/' input.txt
# This command replaces the first occurrence of 'foo' with 'bar' in the file 'input.txt'.

# sed -i.bak -e 's/foo/bar/g' file1.txt file2.txt
# This command replaces all occurrences of 'foo' with 'bar' in 'file1.txt' and 'file2.txt',
# and creates backup files with the extension '.bak'.

# sed -n -e '/pattern/p' input.txt
# This command prints only the lines that match the pattern in the file 'input.txt'.

# sed -r -e 's/(pattern1|pattern2)/replacement/g' input.txt
# This command replaces all occurrences of 'pattern1' or 'pattern2' with 'replacement' in the file 'input.txt',
# using extended regular expressions.

# sed -s -e 's/foo/bar/' input.txt
# This command substitutes the first occurrence of 'foo' with 'bar' in each line of the file 'input.txt'.

# Note: The examples provided are for illustration purposes only.
# The actual usage of sed commands may vary based on specific requirements.
